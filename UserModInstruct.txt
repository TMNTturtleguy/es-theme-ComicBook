Theme Concept based on images posted by: lipebello on Retropie.org.uk/forum
For use with EmulationStation (http://www.emulationstation.org/)

Fonts:
Users can use any font they would like with the theme. Just copy your font to /etc/emulationstation/themes/ComicBook/art folder. 

Gamelist Font Size:
To change the font size of the Gamelist, open the "ComicBook.xml" with a text editor, look for the tag <gamelist> and find a tag inside called <fontSize>. The original value is 0.03. A small change makes a big difference in size. If you want smaller gamelist names, try 0.02. If you want larger, try 0.04. You can even go further by trying 0.015.

Colors:
To change the colors open ComicBook.xml with a text editor. Choose a color and find it's hexidecimal value. Some examples are found in the carbon.xml file. Find all occurances of "8b0000" and replace them with your chosen color. Such as Orange: ef710b. Save the carbon.xml and exit. To change the color to another color after the first change, search for your old color, and replace it with a new one.

Sounds:
- To change the sound effect, replace /art/scroll.wav with what ever WAV file you would like. ComicBook theme will play what ever is called "scroll.wav" in the /art folder.
- Some systems have launching sounds, for example NES plays a coin sound at launch.  To remove the launch sound, edit the theme.xml in the system folder within ComicBook Theme.
- To add launch sound add this to the theme.xml for the system:
		<sound name="launch">
			<path>./../art/XXXX.wav</path>
		</sound>
XXXX = the name of the .wav file.  Add the .wav file to the art forlder.
